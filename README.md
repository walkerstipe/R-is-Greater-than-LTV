# R-is-Greater-than-LTV
Mathematics of Reward in the Reinforcement Learning Compared with Labor Theory of Value

Don't understand LTV well enough yet. LTV certainly superior to current economic estimations of value, (*Ahem, Tesla stock ahem*), but I am dubious if it is correlated highly enough with Life. I've got qualms about the human centric-ness of it as well as the non-inherence, (Albeit emergent so... fair point there), of existence as the fundamental goal of the algorithm. BUT. Dunno for sure yet. Gotta keep reading a good book. How nice!
